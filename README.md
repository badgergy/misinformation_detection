# Misinformation detection

## Background

#### [Open investigation] Detecting misinformation/disinformation

**Type**: research

In this project, you will investigate the detection of misinformation in a novel angle by asking a fundamental question such as: can we use data in multiple languages to enhance the performance of a fake news classifier? This is a very general topic and I expect you to come talk to me with your take on it (your take may or may not be cross-lingual in nature). Keep in mind that the space of potential research questions is bound by the availability of public data, and your capacity to acquire it.



## Basic ideas

- choose the dataset

- an appropriate tech stack (Bert)

- tricky method to solve the problem

  - transfer raw text to IPA to do the prediction

  - **combine the images and text to do the classification**

  - ~~use tts to transfer the text to audio to do the classification~~ (**Not recommended!**)
